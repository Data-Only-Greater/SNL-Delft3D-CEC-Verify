# SNL-Delft3D-CEC-Verify

SNL-Delft3D-CEC-Verify is a python package for automated testing of 
[SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC][2] which adds current energy converter (CEC) support to 
the [Delft3D Flexible Mesh Suite][3]. This package is used to verify the 
performance of SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC by comparing against the 2014 flume 
experiment conducted by Mycek et al.[[1]](#1).

## Installation

:warning: This repository uses [Git LFS][8] to store large files, so if you
want to clone the repository, make sure to use `git lfs clone` to download all
of the files and set up LFS.

The preferred method of installation is to use [Anaconda Python][4]. Download
this package, open an Anaconda prompt and then change directory into the
package root. Now create a conda environment using the following command:

```
(base) > conda env create --file environment.yml
```

Activate the `_snld3d` environment and then install the package:

```
(base) > conda activate _snld3d
(_snld3d) > pip install --no-deps -e .
```

## Example

A short example is provided in the `examples` folder, named `basic.py`. Some
plots are generated which requires the `matplotlib` library. To install it,
type:

```
(_snld3d) > conda install -y matplotlib
```

The example generates a report in [Pandoc][5] markdown format. This report
can be optionally converted to Word format if the `pypandoc` package is 
installed. To install it, type:

```
(_snld3d) > conda install -y pypandoc
```

Currently, a compiled copy of SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC must be available for the 
examples to run. It is also assumed that the binaries are installed in the 
standard location (i.e. in the `src/bin` folder). The location of
SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC can then be specified by setting the `D3D_ROOT` environment 
variable. For example, using PowerShell:

```
(_snld3d) > $env:D3D_ROOT = "\path\to\SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC"
```

Alternatively, the `basic.py` file (and `reference.docx` file if converting to
Word) can be copied to the SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC `examples` directory and run from 
there. To run the example, move to the directory containing `basic.py` and then 
call Python:

```
(_snld3d) > python basic.py
```

If successful, the report files (and images) will be placed in a sub-directory
called `basic_report`.

Currently, the `basic.py` file is the only indicative documentation of how
`SNL-Delft3D-CEC-Verify` is used. Improved documentation of the available 
features will be forthcoming in the near future.

## Testing

To run unit and type testing on the package, first install the required
dependencies:

```
(_snld3d) > conda install -y mypy pytest pytest-mock
```

To run the unit tests, type the following from the root directory:

```
(_snld3d) > pytest
```

To run the type tests, type the following from the root directory:

```
(_snld3d) > mypy src
```

## Uninstall

To remove the conda environment containing SNL-Delft3D-CEC-Verify, open an
Ananconda prompt and type:

```
(base) > conda remove --name _snld3d --all
```

You may need to deactivate the `_snld3d` environment first, if it is still
open, by typing:

```
(_snld3d) > conda deactivate
(base) > conda remove --name _snld3d --all
```
