# SNL-Delft3D-CEC-Verify

SNL-Delft3D-CEC-Verify is a python package for automated testing of 
[SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC][2] which adds current energy converter (CEC) support to 
the [Delft3D Flexible Mesh Suite][3]. This package is used to verify the 
performance of SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC by comparing against the 2014 flume 
experiment conducted by Mycek et al.[[1]](#1).

## Installation

:warning: This repository uses [Git LFS][7] to store large files, so if you
want to clone the repository, make sure to use `git lfs clone` to download all
of the files and set up LFS.

The preferred method of installation is to use [Anaconda Python][4]. Download
this package, open an Anaconda prompt and then change directory into the
package root. Now create a conda environment using the following command:

```
(base) > conda env create --file environment.yml
```

Activate the `_snld3d` environment, setup the channels, and then install the 
SNL-Delft3D-CEC-Verify package:

```
(base) > conda activate _snld3d
(_snld3d) > conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
(_snld3d) > pip install --no-deps -e .
```

## Examples

### Prerequisites

Examples are provided in the `examples` folder. As plots are generated in the
examples, the `matplotlib` library is also required. To install it, type:

```
(_snld3d) > conda install -y matplotlib
```


The examples generate reports in [Pandoc][5] markdown format. These reports 
can be optionally converted to Word format if the `pypandoc` package is 
installed. To install it, type:

```
(_snld3d) > conda install -y pypandoc
```

Currently, a compiled copy of SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC must be available for the 
examples to run. If the binaries are installed in the standard location in the 
Delft3D source code (i.e. in the `src/bin` folder), simply copy the required 
files for each example to the source code's  `examples` directory. A list of 
files required to run each example is provided at the top of the subsections 
below.

Alternatively, the location of SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC binaries can specified by 
setting the `D3D_BIN` environment variable, instead of copying the example 
files. To set `D3D_BIN`, for example, using PowerShell:

```
(_snld3d) > $env:D3D_BIN = "\path\to\SNL-Delft3D-FM-CEC\src\bin"
```

### Basic Example

Required files:
+   `basic.py`
+   `reference.docx` (for conversion to Word format)

The basic example shows how to define a set of simulations with varying
parameters, run the simulations and then analyse the results.

To run the example, move to the directory containing `basic.py` and then 
call Python:

```
(_snld3d) > python basic.py
```

If successful, the report files (and images) will be placed in a sub-directory
called `basic_report`.

### Validation Example

Required files:
+   `validation.py`
+   `validation.bib` (for conversion to Word format)
+   `reference.docx` (for conversion to Word format)

The validation example demonstrates comparison of Delft3D with the experimental
results of Mycek et al.[[1]](#1)

To run the example, move to the directory containing `validation.py` and then 
call Python:

```
(_snld3d) > python validation.py
```

If successful, the report files (and images) will be placed in a sub-directory
called `validation_report`.

## Documentation

API documentation, which describes the classes and functions used in the 
examples, can be found [here][8].

Documentation updates will be ongoing. Instructions for building the 
documentation locally are available [here](docs/README.md).

## Testing

To run unit, type testing and doctests on the package, first install the 
required dependencies:

```
(_snld3d) > conda install -y mypy pytest pytest-mock tox-conda
```

To run the unit tests, type the following from the root directory:

```
(_snld3d) > pytest
```

To run the type tests, type the following from the root directory:

```
(_snld3d) > mypy --install-types src
```

To run doctests, type the following from the root directory:

```
(_snld3d) > pytest --doctest-modules src
```

To run all three test suites simultaneously, invoke tox from the root directory:

```
(_snld3d) > tox
```

Note that tox creates a dedicated environment for the tests, which can be time 
consuming on first run (or if there are any dependency changes).

## Uninstall

To remove the conda environment containing SNL-Delft3D-CEC-Verify, open an
Ananconda prompt and type:

```
(base) > conda remove --name _snld3d --all
```

You may need to deactivate the `_snld3d` environment first, if it is still
open, by typing:

```
(_snld3d) > conda deactivate
(base) > conda remove --name _snld3d --all
```

:warning: Data reversed engineered from Mycek et al.[[1]](#1) is stored within 
this package. If you intend to publish results using this data, make sure to 
acknowledge its source at the point of use, e.g. _"Experimental data reverse 
engineered from Mycek et al.[[1]](#1), fig. 11a."_.

Some of the code in this package is derived from the [delft3dfmpy][6] project.
